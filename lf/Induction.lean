/- SOONER: Readers might expect us to add eqn:H annotations to uses of
   induction, but this changes the shape of the IH in a nasty way! :-(

   the concepts introduced in this chapter. This could help in
   reinforcing the understanding of induction principles. -/
/- LATER: In 3/22, MRC and BCP discussed "inlining" IndPrinciples
   into earlier chapters, thus eliminating it as a chapter. This
   chapter, Induction, is the first place a change would occur.  We
   would present [nat_ind] here. Then in Lists/Poly we'd present
   [list_ind], and the rest would go in IndProp and ProofObjects. The
   main wrinkle is that we'd need to introduce [apply] here instead of
   in Tactics if we want to preserve the presentation. The discussion
   is preserved here: https://github.com/DeepSpec/sfdev/pull/471. -/

# Separate Compilation
-/

/- TERSE: Lean will first need to compile `Basics.lean` so it can be
    imported here -- detailed instructions are in the full version of
    this chapter... -/
/- FULL: Before getting started on this chapter, we need to import
    all of our definitions from the previous chapter: -/

import Basics

/- FULL: For this `import` to work, Lean needs to be able to find a
    compiled version of the previous chapter (`Basics.lean`).  This
    compiled version, called `Basics.olean`, is analogous to the
    `.class` files compiled from `.java` source files and the `.o`
    files compiled from `.c` files.

    When using Lake (Lean's build system), the `lakefile.lean` file
    specifies dependencies and build configuration.  Running `lake build`
    will compile all necessary files in the correct order.

    If you are using VS Code with the Lean 4 extension, compilation
    happens automatically in the background.  When you open a file, the
    extension will compile its dependencies as needed.

    Troubleshooting:

     - If you get complaints about missing imports, make sure you have
       run `lake build` from the project root directory at least once.

     - If you modify `Basics.lean`, VS Code will automatically
       recompile it when you save.  You may need to reopen this file
       or wait for recompilation to finish.

     - If you get errors that seem inconsistent with the source, try
       running `lake clean` followed by `lake build` to recompile
       everything from scratch.

     - If you are using the Lean 4 extension for VS Code,
       you can also restart the extension on the current file
       via the `Restart File` button in the InfoView. The extension
       will often prompt you do this if you change things upstream
       in the dependency tree.

# Proof by Induction
-/

/-
FULL: In Lean, `Nat.add` is defined to recurse on its _second_
argument:

    protected def Nat.add : Nat → Nat → Nat
      | n, 0     => n
      | n, m + 1 => (Nat.add n m) + 1

This means `n + 0` reduces to `n` by definition, but `0 + n` does
_not_.

We can prove that `0` is a neutral element for `+` on the _right_
using just `rfl`:
/FULL

/- add_0_r_easy -/

  intro n; rfl

/- But the proof that `0` is also a neutral element on the _left_ ... -/

/- zero_add_firsttry -/
example : ∀ n : Nat, 0 + n = n := by
/-
TERSE: ... gets stuck.
FULL:
... can't be done in the same simple way.  Just applying
`rfl` doesn't work, since the `n` in `0 + n` is an arbitrary
unknown number, so the `match` in the definition of `+` can't be
simplified.
/FULL
-/
  intro n
  /- `rfl` doesn't work here! -/
  sorry

/- TERSE: *** -/

/-
And reasoning by cases using `cases n` doesn't get us much
further: the branch of the case analysis where we assume `n = 0`
goes through just fine, but in the branch where `n = n' + 1` for
some `n'` we get stuck in exactly the same way.
-/

/- zero_add_secondtry -/
example : ∀ n : Nat, 0 + n = n := by
  intro n
  cases n
  case zero => /- n = 0 -/
    rfl /- so far so good... -/
  case succ n' => /- n = n' + 1 -/
    /- 0 + (n' + 1) reduces to (0 + n') + 1 ...but we're stuck on 0 + n' -/
    sorry

/-
FULL: We could use `cases n'` to get a bit further, but,
since `n` can be arbitrarily large, we'll never get all the way
there if we just go on like this.
-/

/- TERSE: *** -/

/-
FULL: To prove interesting facts about numbers, lists, and other
inductively defined sets, we often need a more powerful reasoning
principle: _induction_.

Recall (from a discrete math course, probably) the _principle of
induction over natural numbers_: If `P(n)` is some proposition
involving a natural number `n` and we want to show that `P` holds for
all numbers `n`, we can reason like this:
     - show that `P(0)` holds;
     - show that, for any `n'`, if `P(n')` holds, then so does
       `P(n' + 1)`;
     - conclude that `P(n)` holds for all `n`.

In Lean, the steps are the same: we begin with the goal of proving
`P(n)` for all `n` and use the `induction` tactic to break it down
into two separate subgoals: one where we must show `P(0)` and another
where we must show `P(n') → P(n' + 1)`.  Here's how this works for
the theorem at hand...
-/

/-
TERSE: We need a bigger hammer: the _principle of induction_ over
natural numbers...

  - If `P(n)` is some proposition involving a natural number `n`,
    and we want to show that `P` holds for _all_ numbers, we can
    reason like this:

     - show that `P(0)` holds
     - show that, if `P(n')` holds, then so does `P(n' + 1)`
     - conclude that `P(n)` holds for all `n`.

For example...
-/

theorem zero_add : ∀ n : Nat, 0 + n = n := by

    rfl
  case succ n' ih => /- n = n' + 1 -/
    /-
    Goal: 0 + (n' + 1) = n' + 1
    By definition of +, `0 + (n' + 1)` reduces to `(0 + n') + 1`.
    Then we can rewrite with the induction hypothesis.
    -/
    rw [add_succ, ih]

/-
FULL: Like `cases`, the `induction` tactic takes a `with` clause
that specifies the names of the variables to be introduced in the
subgoals.  Since there are two subgoals (for `zero` and `succ`),
the `with` clause has two branches.

In the first subgoal, `n` is replaced by `0`.  The goal becomes
`0 + 0 = 0`, which follows by `rfl`.

In the second subgoal, `n` is replaced by `n' + 1`, and the
induction hypothesis `ih : 0 + n' = n'` is added to the context.
The goal becomes `0 + (n' + 1) = n' + 1`.  `add_succ` tells
us that `a + (b + 1) = (a + b) + 1`, so `rw [add_succ]`
transforms the goal to `(0 + n') + 1 = n' + 1`.  Then `rw [ih]`
rewrites `0 + n'` to `n'`, and the goal becomes `n' + 1 = n' + 1`,
which closes automatically.

/-
FULL: In Lean, as in informal mathematics, large proofs are often
broken into a sequence of theorems, with later proofs referring to
earlier theorems.  But sometimes a proof will involve some
miscellaneous fact that is too trivial and of too little general
interest to bother giving it its own top-level name.  In such
cases, it is convenient to be able to simply state and prove the
required fact "in place".  The `have` tactic allows us to do this.

   proof (with 0+n was provable just by reflexivity!).  The new one is
   still straightforward without the replace, but maybe not quite so

We prove it immediately, and then it's available as a hypothesis
for the rest of the proof.

/-
FULL: As another example, suppose we want to prove that `(n + m)
+ (p + q) = (m + n) + (p + q)`. The only difference between the
two sides of the `=` is that the arguments `m` and `n` to the
first inner `+` are swapped, so it seems we should be able to use
the commutativity of addition (`add_comm`) to rewrite one into the
other.  However, the `rw` tactic is not very smart about _where_
it applies the rewrite.  There are three uses of `+` here, and
`rw [add_comm]` may affect the wrong one...

  it! (APT '21: In fact, the [Import Setoid] is already happening
  silently via the [Require Export String] in Basics.v But sadly, we
  would need to use [setoid_rewrite...at] instead of plain
  [rewrite...at], since they have different semantics (despite what
  the reference manual seems to imply).) (And even if we choose not

  involves explaining the difference between a universally quantified
  variable and a fixed but arbitrary value is... problematic... at

# Formal vs. Informal Proof
-/

/- "Informal proofs are algorithms; formal proofs are code." -/

/-
What constitutes a successful proof of a mathematical claim?

The question has challenged philosophers for millennia, but a
rough and ready answer could be this: A proof of a mathematical
proposition `P` is a written (or spoken) text that instills in the
reader or hearer the certainty that `P` is true -- an unassailable
argument for the truth of `P`.  That is, a proof is an act of
communication.

Acts of communication may involve different sorts of readers.  On
one hand, the "reader" can be a program like Lean, in which case
the "belief" that is instilled is that `P` can be mechanically
derived from a certain set of formal logical rules, and the proof
is a recipe that guides the program in checking this fact.  Such
recipes are _formal_ proofs.

Alternatively, the reader can be a human being, in which case the
proof will probably be written in English or some other natural
language and will thus necessarily be _informal_.  Here, the
criteria for success are less clearly specified.  A "valid" proof
is one that makes the reader believe `P`.  But the same proof may
be read by many different readers, some of whom may be convinced
by a particular way of phrasing the argument, while others may not
be. Some readers may be particularly pedantic, inexperienced, or
just plain thick-headed; the only way to convince them will be to
make the argument in painstaking detail.  Other readers, more
familiar in the area, may find all this detail so overwhelming
that they lose the overall thread; all they want is to be told the
main ideas, since it is easier for them to fill in the details for
themselves than to wade through a written presentation of them.
Ultimately, there is no universal standard, because there is no
single way of writing an informal proof that will convince every
conceivable reader.

In practice, however, mathematicians have developed a rich set of
conventions and idioms for writing about complex mathematical
objects that -- at least within a certain community -- make
communication fairly reliable.  The conventions of this stylized
form of communication give a reasonably clear standard for judging
proofs good or bad.

Because we are using Lean in this course, we will be working
heavily with formal proofs.  But this doesn't mean we can
completely forget about informal ones!  Formal proofs are useful
in many ways, but they are _not_ very efficient ways of
communicating ideas between human beings.
-/

/- For example, here is a proof that addition is associative: -/

/- add_assoc' -/
theorem add_assoc' : ∀ n m p : Nat,
    n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p := by
  intro n m p
  induction p
  case zero => rfl
  case succ p' ih =>
    rw [add_succ m p', add_succ n (m + p'), add_succ (n + m) p', ih]

/-
Lean is perfectly happy with this.  For a human, however, it
is difficult to make much sense of it.  We can use comments and
focused cases to show the structure a little more clearly...
JC: This would be a great location to introduce `calc`!
-/

/- add_assoc'' -/
theorem add_assoc'' : ∀ n m p : Nat,
    n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p := by

  case succ p' ih => /- p = p' + 1 -/
    rw [add_succ m p', add_succ n (m + p'), add_succ (n + m) p', ih]

/-
... and if you're used to Lean you might be able to step
through the tactics one after the other in your mind and imagine
the state of the context and goal stack at each point, but if the
proof were even a little bit more complicated this would be next
to impossible.

A (pedantic) mathematician might write the proof something like
this:
-/

/-
- _Theorem_: For any `n`, `m` and `p`,

      n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p.

  _Proof_: By induction on `p`.

  - First, suppose `p = 0`.  We must show that

        n + (m + 0) = (n + m) + 0.

    This follows directly from the definition of `+`
    (since `x + 0 = x` for any `x`).

  - Next, suppose `p = p' + 1`, where

        n + (m + p') = (n + m) + p'.

    We must now show that

        n + (m + (p' + 1)) = (n + m) + (p' + 1).

    By the definition of `+`, both sides reduce to

        (n + (m + p')) + 1   and   ((n + m) + p') + 1

    respectively, which are equal by the induction hypothesis.
    _Qed_.
-/

/-HIDE -/
/- MMG: the proof above makes no use of lemmas, so it's hard for
   students to know what to do.  It might be good to also give them a
   sample proof of mult_1_l so they know how to "invoke" things
   they've already proved.  -/
/- /HIDE  -/

/-
The overall form of the proof is basically similar, and of
course this is no accident: Lean has been designed so that its
`induction` tactic generates the same sub-goals, in the same
order, as the bullet points that a mathematician would usually
write.  But there are significant differences of detail: the
formal proof is much more explicit in some ways (e.g., the use of
`rfl`) but much less explicit in others (in particular, the "proof
state" at any given point in the Lean proof is completely implicit,
whereas the informal proof reminds the reader several times where
things stand).

EX2AM? (add_comm_informal)
Translate your solution for `add_comm` into an informal proof:

Theorem: Addition is commutative.

Proof: -- SOLUTION
   Let natural numbers `n` and `m` be given.  We show `n + m = m +
   n` by induction on `m`.

   - First, suppose `m = 0`.  We must show `n + 0 = 0 + n`.  By
     the definition of `+`, `n + 0 = n`.  We have already shown
     (lemma `zero_add`) that `0 + n = n`.  Thus both sides equal
     `n`.

   - Next, suppose `m = m' + 1` for some `m'`, where `n + m' = m'
     + n`.  We must show that `n + (m' + 1) = (m' + 1) + n`.  By
     the definition of `+`, `n + (m' + 1) = (n + m') + 1`.  By
     `succ_add`, `(m' + 1) + n = (m' + n) + 1`.  By the induction
     hypothesis, `n + m' = m' + n`, so both sides equal

     must show `(n' + 1 == n' + 1) = true`. This
     follows directly from the induction hypothesis and the
     definition of `eqb`.

  | b1 (n : Bin)

/-
Before you start working on the next exercise, replace the stub
definitions of `incr` and `binToNat`, below, with your solution
from Basics.  That will make it possible for this file to be graded
on its own.
-/

def incr (m : Bin) : Bin

  | .z => .b1 .z
  | .b0 m' => .b1 m'
  | .b1 m' => .b0 (incr m')
  -- /ADMITDEF

def binToNat (m : Bin) : Nat
  -- ADMITDEF
  := match m with
  | .z => 0
  | .b0 m' => binToNat m' * 2
  | .b1 m' => binToNat m' * 2 + 1
  -- /ADMITDEF

In Basics, we did some unit testing of `binToNat`, but we
didn't prove its correctness. Now we'll do so.

EX3! (binary_commute)
Prove that the following diagram commutes:

                            incr
              Bin ----------------------> Bin
               |                           |
    binToNat   |                           |  binToNat
               |                           |
               v                           v
              Nat ----------------------> Nat
                           + 1

That is, incrementing a binary number and then converting it to
a (unary) natural number yields the same result as first converting
it to a natural number and then incrementing.

If you want to change your previous definitions of `incr` or `binToNat`
to make the property easier to prove, feel free to do so!

Prove that, if we start with any `Nat`, convert it to `Bin`, and
convert it back, we get the same `Nat` which we started with.

Hint: This proof should go through smoothly using the previous
exercise about `incr` as a lemma. If not, revisit your definitions
of the functions involved and consider whether they are more
complicated than necessary: the shape of a proof by induction will
match the recursive structure of the program being verified, so
make the recursions as simple as possible.

GRADE_THEOREM 1: double_incr_bin
-/

/- [] -/

/- Let's return to our desired theorem: -/

example : ∀ b, natToBin (binToNat b) = b := by sorry

/-
The theorem fails because there are some `Bin` such that we won't
necessarily get back to the _original_ `Bin`, but instead to an
"equivalent" `Bin`.  (We deliberately leave that notion undefined
here for you to think about.)

Explain in a comment, below, why this failure occurs. Your
explanation will not be graded, but it's important that you get it
clear in your mind before going on to the next part. If you're
stuck on this, think about alternative implementations of
`doubleBin` that might have failed to satisfy `double_bin_zero`
yet otherwise seem correct.
-/

/-
SOLUTION
The problem is that `0` has many representations: it can be written
`.z`, `.b0 .z`, `.b0 (.b0 .z)`, and so on.  For these alternate
representations, if you do `binToNat` then `natToBin`, you
don't get back what you started with.

Any other number also has many representations, after applying
constructors to the multiple representations of zero.
/SOLUTION
-/

/-
To solve that problem, we can introduce a _normalization_ function
that selects the simplest `Bin` out of all the equivalent
`Bin`. Then we can prove that the conversion from `Bin` to `Nat` and
back again produces that normalized, simplest `Bin`.
-/

/- EX4A (bin_nat_bin) -/

/-
Define `normalize`. You will need to keep its definition as simple
as possible for later proofs to go smoothly. Do not use
`binToNat` or `natToBin`, but do use `doubleBin`.

Hint: Structure the recursion such that it _always_ reaches the
end of the `Bin` and _only_ processes each bit once. Do not
try to "look ahead" at future bits.
-/

def normalize (b : Bin) : Bin :=
  /- ADMITDEF -/
  match b with
  | .z => .z
  | .b0 b' => doubleBin (normalize b')
  | .b1 b' => incr (doubleBin (normalize b'))
  /- /ADMITDEF -/

/-
It would be wise to do some `example` proofs to check that your
definition of `normalize` works the way you intend before you
proceed. They won't be graded, but fill them in below.

/-
Finally, prove the main theorem. The inductive cases could be a
bit tricky.

Hint: Start by trying to prove the main statement, see where you
get stuck, and see if you can find a lemma -- perhaps requiring
its own inductive proof -- that will allow the main proof to make
progress. We have one lemma for the `b0` case (which also makes
use of `double_incr_bin`) and another for the `b1` case.
